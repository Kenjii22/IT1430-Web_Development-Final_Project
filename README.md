# IT1430-Web_Development-Final_Project
This is the final result of my IT 1430 Web Page Development project. 
 
This assignment was used to teach me how to:
develop web pages using a mark-up language,
to develop dynamic web pages using JavaScript and CSS,
and to design web pages in accordance with good design principles 
& using appropriate styles and formats

My job was to create a web site for a city (real or fictional). 
The web site will have 4 pages: a homepage, a page showing the
cityâ€™s points of interest, a page for local businesses, and a page to 
submit upcoming city events.
