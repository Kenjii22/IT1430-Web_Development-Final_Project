			<h2> About the City </h2>
				<p> Jubilife City is the first large city that a new trainer will run into
					when they start their journey. Being known as "The City of Joy," multiple  
					businesses such as the Jubilife TV station, the Trainer School, the Global
					Trade Center, and the headquarters of the Pokétch Company.</p>
				
				<p> There are 4 points of entry for the city in each of the cardinal directions.
					The south entrance connects to Route 202 followed by Sandgem Town. The east 
					entrance connects to Route 203 and leads to Oreburgh City. The north entrance
					leads to Route 204 and Floaroma Town. The west entrance leads to Route 218 
					and Canalave City. </p>
				
				<h3> Why Jubilife? </h3>
					<p> I first started playing <em>Pokémon</em> when I was really young and 
						have been following the franchise ever since. I thought that using one of 
						the bigger cities from the first game I played of the series would be a 
						good idea.</p>
